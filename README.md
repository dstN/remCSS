# remCSS
Minimalistic PURE CSS Framework based on rem.

## Get remCSS on npm
```
npm install remframe
```

## remCSS Demopage
Check out the demo on [dstn.github.io/remCSS](https://dstn.github.io/remCSS/).

The demopage will be in your OS-chosen lighting mode (dark/bright). You can change this in Chrome in the console-rendering options, because it's done with media queries asking for prefered color scheme.
